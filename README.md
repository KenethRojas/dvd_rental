The following project was realized in order to determinate which film category would be more beneficial to expand their inventory for a dvd rental company. So, a SQl code was built to analyze further this issue, where, as you may see in the query, the data scraping was focused mainly on the rental quantities, the total amounts of sales and the unique customers each of the film categories has.

* The data was acquired from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/coolusername/dvdrental
